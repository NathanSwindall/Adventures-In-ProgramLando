# About

Hi there! My name is Nathan Swindall and I am a software engineer. I have used many different technologies such as the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), and am familiar with many other languages as well. I am quite fluent in Google technologies such as Google Apps Script and Google Data Studio as I run many business operations on them. Currently, I am interested in functional languages such as Elm, Haskell, and Elixir (Phoenix Framework). Hopefully my blogs inspire more people to pick up these technologies as I would love it everyone could experience the joy of a functioning app after teetering through the arduous development process.
