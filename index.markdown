<h1 class="front-page-header">Welcome!</h1>

This is my blog for my journey through the programming world and uncovering all the beauties and splendors along the way. I hope you have as much fun exploring the many blog posts as I did creating them, and If you are new here, there are two different blogs. One is my tech blog which I tackle fun and exciting frontiers like the world of functional programming and the other is ... well ... just random. I talk about fun topics such as getting your irish citizenship and cooking persian dishes. Enjoy!
