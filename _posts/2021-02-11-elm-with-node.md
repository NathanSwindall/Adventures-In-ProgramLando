## Problem

While going through the book [Elm in Action] problems I ran into while using elm is that I kept having to type in the command `elm make client/src/PhotoGroove.elm --output client/app.js` which isn't really that bad, but when I came from using node.js to develop up the backend for apps, having a live reload became almost a given.
