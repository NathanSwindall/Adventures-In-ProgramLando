# About

Hi there! My name is Nathan Swindall and I am a software engineer. I have used many different technologies such as the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), and am familiar with many other languages as well. As a software engineer at Prep to Your Door, I mainly used python for writing scripts to automate certain company tasks. One task involved compiling different pdfs together and formatting them correctly to be printed as labels for the company products. Most of the backend operations involved Google Sheets, thus Google Apps Script was a perfect language for manipulating and connecting many APIs to the them. 

Currently, I am very interested in functional languages such as Elm, Haskell, and Elixir (Phoenix Framework).
