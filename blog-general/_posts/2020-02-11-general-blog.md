I stopped drinking dairy quite awhile ago because it always gave me an upset stomach afterwards where I had terrible bloating and pain, so I haven't had yogurt in almost a year now. The other day I was at the grocery store and I noticed that they had a new type of yogurt I had never seen before and this one didn't contain any dairy. Of course being yogurt starved for a long time I happily bought it. Of course, since it is a plant based yogurt it is quite expensive, but I have to say that it was extremely tasty... the only problem is that I really can't justify the exorbitant price. 

# *An Idea!!*

I was curious if it was easy to make yogurt, so I did a quick youtube search of almond and cashew recipes. I actually have quite a lot of experience with fermentations as I have fermented my own sauerkraut and kefir before. The first video I came across was one by [Mic the Vegan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahnhYA7o4VE). In his video, he presents an extremely easy way to make "yogurt" which is more akin to fermented cashew and almond paste. I initially tried this way and it wasn't too bad, but I was curious if there was a way to make it creamy.


# *The two plant-based yogurt versions*

It seems there are two different philosophies when it comes to making plant yogurts, which are to pulp or no pulp. What I mean is that some videos they first make almond,cashew, or soy milk and then make the yogurt out of these milks. For example, if you watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWHw4xYsDyg&t=281s) youtube video by veganlovlie, you will see that they first separate out the pulp and then ferment it.

Now when it comes to doing recipes for anything, I usually try to do the easier one. I have tried doing the first method with some pitfalls including a very nasty ferment where it got contaminated with some sort of yeast. I'm not sure what yeast or fungus it is, but I have encountered it enought times to get a cold sweat across my forehead when I smell its rather unpleasant aroma. 

If you want to know what it smells like in order to be on the look out for what a good and bad ferment should smell like, just soak a grain of your choice in a closed container for three days and open it up. It is like the fungus channeled Mike Tyson's spirit into the container as it gives a KO punch to your nostrils on first hit. The worst part is that this fungus can leave a lasting unwashable smell on any plastics you use in the process which unfortunately meant the ring of my instant pot.

# *Important Considerations*

One important consideration when it came to making my yogurt too was that I wanted to include certain probiotic strains in it, so that I could have a scienced-backed yogurt that would help with certain ailments I have. I suffer from
