At my current job, I am using Vue.js with ASP.Net Core, but I haven't used ASP.Net Core in a long time and decided to go through a course to get my skills up to par again. This will be a section that will include quite a few notes on how to run an API with a frontend. The frontend will be React.js even though I am very familiar with Vue.js. I might add a tutorial for other frameworks in here too like Vue.js and Elm and build them concurrently.
