<h1 style="text-align: center"><strong>Starting My Godot Journey</strong></h1>
There are many interesting gaming engines our there in the world to start creating your own games. Of course there are the giants like Unity, and Unreal, but they are proprietary software where you can't edit the actual game engine. Godot is open and you can actually go in and edit the underlying code (though it is in C++) if you want. This is a good enough reasons since maybe I'd like to edit the mechanics, but after trying out Unity, I found Godot to be slightly more intuitive to use. There are also some great tutorials on Udemy that I have bought, and I think it's time to give them a try. I am also very curious, (after talking to other developers developing their own games), if mixing in F# and C# into my games can cut down on bugs and make it more manageable. Thus, that is why I am creating this new blog section, in order to mess around with the possibilities of mixing both F# and C# into games.
