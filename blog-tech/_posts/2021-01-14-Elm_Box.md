## Prereqs

In order to do this tutorial, you need to have elm installed on your system. The easiest way to install elm is to do so through npm. If you don't have node already, then go over to [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/). Then, once you have this installed (it should come with npm), you can run the command `npm install -g elm` which will install elm to your system. I am using the ide [visual studio code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) which has a great plugin for elm which is made by [elm-tooling](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Elmtooling.elm-ls-vscode). I made quick youtube video that covers the installation and repl here [elm installation and repl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XT5Qh5xdyI&t=254s).

## Initial Problem

There exists a factory in Norway that has a huge problem with their products. When they package their products into a small-sized box, the products keep getting destroyed by all the trolls that live in Norway. The head boss of the factory came up with a brilliant idea to wrap the small-sized boxes into medium-sized boxes, and then again in large-sized boxes. Thus, all the products are first packaged in small boxes that can hold only one product. Then, each of these boxes are further packed into medium-sized boxes which can hold only two small boxes. Finally, these boxes are then packaged into large-sized boxes that can hold only two medium-sized boxes.

## Basics

Feel free to skip this part if you are already familiar with some of the elm syntax. 

### primitive types

The first thing you want to do to get started is getting used to the elm repl. In order to open the elm repl in your terminal all you have to do is type in `elm repl`. Once you are in the elm repl you can enter very basic items to get a foot on how the language acts. For example, if you enter:

```elm
"Hello, World"
```

You get back the following.

You'll notice that this has `::String` at the end of it. This is the type of the value you entered into the repl. This will become very important as you move on into more advance topics. You can type in a few other stuff too like numbers and floats and do basic arithmetic.

### functions

#### type signatures

We can even create your own simple functions. For example you can a simple square function by putting `square x = x*x` into the repl. When you put this into the repl, you'll notice that you get back a weird type signature which is `<function> : number -> number`. Whenever you see the `->` you know that you are working with a function. The signature is saying that the function takes a number and returns a number. We can create other functions and see what their type signatures are. For example, we can do multiple arguments such as `add a b c = a + b + c`. You'll notice that the type signature for this function is `<function> : number -> number -> number`. This is saying that you have a function that takes a number, and then it takes another number, and finally returns a number. 

You can actually specify the type signature for a function. All you have to in order to do this is to put the type signature above the function. Let's make a really useless function that takes any type of string and returns 42.

```elm
stringForNumber : String -> number
stringForNumber myStr = 42
```

Not the most exciting function but it has many important properties. If you just put the function without the type signature into the repl then you will get a type signature that is a little different which is `<function> : a -> number`. Whenever you have a lowercase type in the type signature, it means that this type is variable. Thus, the `a` in the type signature is a variable and it can be any type such as a list, number, or an algebraic type which we will learn about later. 

You can put the type signature into the repl, but you have to put it in as the first line. So first enter `stringForNumber : String -> number` first and then enter `stringForNumber myStr = 42`. 

#### partial application

Going back to the add function we created earlier, if we actually try this function we just supply three numbers and we will get back them all added together.

But what happens if we only call the function with only a few different arguments. So instead of calling something like `add 3 5 3`, we enter something like `add 3` into the repl. This is actually perfectly acceptable in Elm and it will actually give use back a new function that takes only two arguments. We can actually create new function based of adding knowing this fact. For example check out this picture:

[img that has partial application with add]

This is called partial application. In many languages such as JavaScript, they take their arguments as tuples so you can't leave off any of the arguments, but in Elm the arguments are curried. This means that you can supply fewer arguments to a function and get back another function. This feature of the language will come in handy later with shortening our code and make our code more readable.

#### anonymous functions

The last basic topic we will cover about functions will be anonymous functions. If you have ever used node.js, you are probably very familiar with arrow functions which are just anonymous functions. In Elm, you write an anonymous function using the syntax like `\x -> x + 10`. You can also put in multiple arguments into an anonymous function like this `\x y -> x + y`. Below is a small repl session that uses anonymous functions.
