"Turn the corner from “Haskell student” to “Haskell developer.” Haskell in Depth explores the important language features and programming skills you’ll need to build production-quality software using Haskell. And along the way, you’ll pick up some interesting insights into why Haskell looks and works the way it does. Get ready to go deep!

Purchase of the print book includes a free eBook in PDF, Kindle, and ePub formats from Manning Publications.

About the technology

Software for high-precision tasks like financial transactions, defense systems, and scientific research must be absolutely, provably correct. As a purely functional programming language, Haskell enforces a mathematically rigorous approach that can lead to concise, efficient, and bug-free code. To write such code you’ll need deep understanding. You can get it from this book!

About the book

Haskell in Depth unlocks a new level of skill with this challenging language. Going beyond the basics of syntax and structure, this book opens up critical topics like advanced types, concurrency, and data processing. You’ll discover key parts of the Haskell ecosystem and master core design patterns that will transform how you write software.

What's inside

Building applications, web services, and networking apps
Using sophisticated libraries like lens, singletons, and servant
Organizing projects with Cabal and Stack
Error-handling and testing
Pure parallelism for multicore processors"
